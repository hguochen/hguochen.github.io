Hello octopress! I've made the switch from wordpress finally. Somehow the idea of having a database for my blog doesn't sound right. So here are the few changes made to my blog arsenals:

1. Blog framework [Octopress](http://octopress.org)
2. Blog served with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
3. Blog language [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics)
4. Blog editor [Mou](http://mouapp.com)

Still pretty new to markdown syntax but i'm already loving it. Cheers to a wonderful 2014!
