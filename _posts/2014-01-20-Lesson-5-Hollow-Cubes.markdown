I'm gona be drawing hollow cubes for this lesson. Drawing lines that **sync** with each other is pretty important when drawing cubes. 

> **Parallel and Perpendicular Lines**
> Parallel lines are two lines going in the same direction, spaced equally apart. Perpendicular lines are two lines that intersect at right angles to each other. 

1. Sketch a foreshortened cube.
2. Slant back two parallel lines on the top of the cube.
3. Think of a compass, the 4 most commonly used directions are, **Northwest**, **Northeast**, **Southwest**, and **Southeast**.
4. Draw the parallel side of the box lid lifting up with two parallel lines.
5. Use the bottom of the box angles to guide your line directions, complete near the flaps, aligning them up in direction NE and NW. By always referring the lines you have already drawn and by continually checking your angles against the drawing direction reference cube, your drawings will look solid, focused, and 3D.
6. When casting shadows, we are casting at the SW direction instead of downwards. This will go well with the light source which is in NE direction. 

Try drawing the cube a few more times to get the directional cues correct. Here's what i've drawn:
