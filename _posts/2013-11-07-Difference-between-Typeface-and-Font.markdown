Web designers often use the terms typeface and font interchanged. So is there actually a difference between them? Yes. A typeface is what you see. It is an artistic impression of how text looks, feels and reads. A font is a file that includes a typeface. Using a font allow you to access its typeface.

To put it simply, let us draw the analogy between song and MP3. A typeface is like a song that is a work of art by an artist. A font, on the other hand, is very similar to an MP3 in that it is not an art by itself, but a medium to carry an artist's impression.
