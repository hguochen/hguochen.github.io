Work is your life because work is your passion. If your work isn't your passion, only a means of getting to your passion, then take it as a necessity and look it in as positive a light as possible. Your work doesn’t suck because it is getting you to where you want to be. It’s necessary and unavoidable if you want to get to where you want to be, for the life you wish to lead.

Don’t distinguish between work and life. It is one in the same and the sooner you accept that, the sooner you can release all that negativity you feel every time you think about all the work that needs to be done.
