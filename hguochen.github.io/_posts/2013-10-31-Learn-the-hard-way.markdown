In the forever pursuit for **getting more done with less** in our lives, there is just one thing that just can’t fit this ideal – learning.

Learning has no shortcuts. It is a long and tedious process of practicing again and again until you can’t get it wrong. Forget about **GET 2X THE RESULT FOR 1/2 THE EFFORT**, they only happen in advertisements. The truth is, you can never be comfortable with the results of learning unless it is real hard work.

Learning coding? Pick up the dictionary-like ‘Basic C Programming’ book and start flipping. Picking up running? Draw up a schedule and hit the pavement. At the end of the day, be proud to tell people, 'i’m self-taught, yet professionally trained.'
