I've been using the [Nike+](http://nikeplus.nike.com/plus/products/gps_app/) app for my distance runs for awhile and it's truly awesome!

After 113 distance runs, i'm finally in the blue zone, the 1000km club. Somehow, this app always manages to beat my laziness and make me go after the mileages.

You should try it!
