    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So 3 quarters of 2015 just flew by and i&rsquo;ve almost spent a year in the silicon valley as a software engineer already. Alot of things happened, some things i&rsquo;m extremely thankful for and some not so much. Here are some of the things that defined my 2015, mainly for self-reflection but if this piece helped you in some way, i&rsquo;d love to hear from you.</p>

<h3>1. Hardwork pays off</h3>

<p>I worked really hard and learnt a whole bunch of stuff this year. When i first came over to the silicon valley, i never saw myself as a software engineer much. More of a web developer. I wanted to change that, so i grabbed every opportunity to learn. My job requires working python, django knowledge and i think i did that fairly well. But deep down i never really understood the intracies of software development and under-the-hood details. So i dug into the core of my company&rsquo;s technology stack and went through every single bit of details and familiarized myself with tools like Vagrant, Salt, Celery, Redis, Nginx, AWS services along the way. The more i read about these tools, the more curious i am on how other companies built their technology stacks.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So i just chanced upon what i think is the most discriminatory Job Description(JD) ever. Either the company is trying too hard to be hip or they are simply jerks.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the <a href="http://careers.wewantsugar.com/jobs/4413-lead-software-engineer-technical-sugar-singapore">brain numbing JD</a> by a Singapore startup called <a href="http://www.wewantsugar.com">wewantsugar</a>. Don&rsquo;t be fooled by its name, there&rsquo;s no sweetness whatsoever as far as i can see. Let&rsquo;s go through what&rsquo;s wrong with this piece of golden nugget.</p>

<p><strong>Here&rsquo;s what they want:</strong></p>

<p><img src="http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k508/houguochen/Screen_Shot_2014-09-24_at_2_50_00_pm.png" width="600" alt="paragraph 1" /></p>

<p>First of all you sidelined majority of Singaporeans whose life inadvertently goes down the path of having kids, buying flat, cars and awaiting CPF withdrawal. So are you implying none of your employees would ever take this path? I&rsquo;d imagine that would be a really scary company to work with.</p>

<p>Next. The notion of working till midnight is a circumstance of situation, NOT a default choice. We developers never starts off a day telling ourselves &ldquo;damn i&rsquo;m gona make sure i work late into the night.&rdquo; When we do, it&rsquo;s because we are passionate for what we do and we feel responsible enough to finish what we started. How come you never mentioned anything about productivity? What&rsquo;s your reason for wanting someone who willingly want to work late into the night? So that you can work-torture the poor dude and slap a &lsquo;he likes it anyway&rsquo; statement to justify your abuse? That&rsquo;s a really cruel employer.</p>

<p><strong>Feeling good yet? Here&rsquo;s who they don&rsquo;t want:</strong>
<img src="http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k508/houguochen/Screen_Shot_2014-09-24_at_3_22_59_pm.png" width="600" alt="paragraph 2" /></p>

<p>Just what&rsquo;s with shaming of the corporates by calling them &lsquo;shallow social climber&rsquo;? How does wanting to work for prestigious companies like Goldman Sachs make them shallow? The very organisations you marginalise gave you your bank account, connected your cellphone to your loved ones and makes sure there&rsquo;s food to be bought when you visit NTUCs. Your every statement tells me you despise people who doesn&rsquo;t share your beliefs and dreams while being painfully oblivious to what&rsquo;s around you. Speaking of shallow, this company seems to fit the bill quite well.</p>

<p>Oh and you don&rsquo;t want social misfits? You don&rsquo;t want people who were always the last to get picked? Sounds like you are the big bad bully in school whom everyone hated. You know what? Some of the most successful technology companies are where they are today because the misfits envisioned something others didn&rsquo;t and built products that made everyone else&rsquo;s life better. But i&rsquo;m glad you didn&rsquo;t see that. Least you ruin the opportunity cost of another genius in the making. By the way, your advice, &lsquo;go seek help from a mental health professional&rsquo; is totally misguided and only goes to show how ugly you are as a person. Misfits do not have a mental condition, this company&rsquo;s management does.</p>

<p><strong>Still Convinced you are perfect for this job? Here&rsquo;s their requirements:</strong></p>

<p><img src="http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k508/houguochen/ScreenShot2014-09-24at31630pm.png" width="400" alt="paragraph 3" /></p>

<p>Holy shit! That&rsquo;s even longer than my mum&rsquo;s monthly shopping list. You must be looking to hire <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk">Elon Musk</a> and ready to pay shitloads of salary compensation.</p>

<p><img src="http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k508/houguochen/Screen_Shot_2014-09-24_at_3_19_11_pm.png" width="600" alt="paragraph 4" /></p>

<p>Did you know that in <a href="http://www.mom.gov.sg/employment-practices/fair-employment/Pages/fair-employment.aspx">Singapore&rsquo;s Ministry of Manpower Employment Act</a>, it is forbidden to ask potential employees for photographs as a factor of employment considerations? Look like either you need to do more homework or you chose to disregard the employment act totally. Either ways, how can employees even start to trust that you will take care of them?</p>

<p>Oh look, for a Lead Software Engineer position and all that essential attributes and requirements, you are paying SGD4,000 - 5,000? It&rsquo;s like asking for whales and paying peanuts.</p>

<p>Those are two full pages of prejudices, discriminatory remarks and statements that shows how ugly this employer can get. I am a software engineer and i would NEVER work for this company ever. I would strongly advise every software engineer to stay clear of your company as well.</p>

<p>Again, here&rsquo;s the <a href="http://careers.wewantsugar.com/jobs/4413-lead-software-engineer-technical-sugar-singapore">brain numbing JD</a>. Just why isn&rsquo;t there some sort of ethics or personality test before someone is allowed to incorporate a company?</p>

    <link href="http://blog.hguochen.com/random/startup/2014/05/29/Culture-in-the-Silicon-Valley/"/>
    <updated>2014-05-29T16:12:51-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.hguochen.com/random/startup/2014/05/29/Culture-in-the-Silicon-Valley</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In a recent visit to California, i visited a number of famous companies in the Silicon Valley such as Google, Facebook, Evernote, Quora, Airbnb etc. These are all the &lsquo;cool&rsquo; companies with great cultures that many would die to get in. But what really does it mean to have a great culture? Sure the oversized bean bags, foosball tables, free meals and modern-looking workspaces forms part of it. But as i learnt from the many visits, great culture is more than materialistic satisfactions and cool company perks.</p>

<p>The key, is that everyone in the company thinks alike. What does it mean? It means a collective group of people come together to live and breathe on the same set of problems, every single day. They believe that a company is greater than the sum of its parts. They sweat the mission and vision of their greater entity.</p>

<p>At Facebook, everyone wants to build things that makes people stay connected. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if their role isn&rsquo;t engineering. The company hired people who care about being social no matter what discipline they are in so this trait integrates into their daily work. They ruthlessly scrutinize their work in order to produce the best products that makes millions of people say &lsquo;hello&rsquo; each day. It is this shared camaraderie the eliminates frustrations when a better design is shot down by an engineering manager who just wants to fix bugs.</p>

<p>Airbnb wants to unlock unique spaces worldwide. This vision tickles down to every single one of its employees. In order for that, the company built an environment where you can spend time building a global reach instead of having to fight for time to do your laundry, or get frustrated over expensive lunches. All mundane things are taken care of, so you can focus on what really matters.</p>

<p>All these, brings the idea that executing a company vision needs to be everyone&rsquo;s job. Is everybody sharing the company&rsquo;s delights and sorrows? Does everyone talk about user&rsquo;s problems or talk about their own problems? I think a big reason why these companies consistently hit the top of &lsquo;Dream company to work for&rsquo; list is that they&rsquo;ve figured out how to solve its employee&rsquo;s little problems, in return for these talents helping to solve company&rsquo;s big problems. It is also this realization that differentiates between a good company and a great company.</p>

<p>When you walk into your office tomorrow, start listening to what your employees are saying. If you can&rsquo;t help them solve their daily problems, don&rsquo;t expect them to solve yours.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In 4 day&rsquo;s time, i&rsquo;ll be visiting California-US for the first time in my life. Being <a href="http://hguochen.com">a startup guy</a> myself, this is a big deal for me. I&rsquo;m really excited to see what the biggest startup ecosystem in the world is like. I wanted to make this trip a really memorable one but i didn&rsquo;t have enough contacts there. So i shamelessly cold-emailed some of my favourite tech companies in California asking for an impromptu visit to their offices/campus. Some of these companies accepted my request(thank you so much!). But 1 of which just blew me away. Here&rsquo;s what happened.</p>

<p>I have always been a big fan of <a href="http://evernote.com">Evernote</a>. After several failed attempts to link up with evernote staff through friend introductions, i resorted to cold-emailing its CEO, Phil Libin on linkedin&hellip;</p>

<p><img src="http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k508/houguochen/email_phil_libin.jpg" width="500" alt="Email Phil Libin" /></p>

<p>Ok i admit, its kinda cheesy. But hey, i wasn&rsquo;t expecting a reply.</p>

<p>And so i didn&rsquo;t. Then i tried to ping the CEO on twitter, and i got a reply! Well, not Phil Libin himself, but still a reply :)</p>

<p><img src="http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k508/houguochen/Mobile%20Uploads/08915870-515D-4157-83DE-FD8EAB45C3C1.png" width="250" alt="Tweeting Phil Libin" /></p>

<p>Things are looking good! So i followed the instructions and the following conversations ensue:</p>

<p><img src="http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k508/houguochen/Mobile%20Uploads/6734508A-2E9D-4FD7-AC1E-9637083A4991.png" width="250" alt="evernote support 1" />

<p>A few days later, this email from Evernote&rsquo;s marketing manager came:</p>

<p><img src="http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k508/houguochen/evernote_email.png" width="1050" alt="evernote email" /></p>

<p>How excited was i to read this? Let&rsquo;s just say that my laptop keyboard now comes coffee-flavoured. Thank you Evernote, you&rsquo;ve just made a fan very very happy :)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be giving a full recount of my visit to Evernote HQ sometime later. In the meantime, please leave in the comments below if you have a request for me on visiting Evernote :)</p>
