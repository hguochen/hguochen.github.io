Work is your life because work is your passion. If your work isn&rsquo;t your passion, only a means of getting to your passion, then take it as a necessity and look it in as positive a light as possible. Your work doesn’t suck because it is getting you to where you want to be. It’s necessary and unavoidable if you want to get to where you want to be, for the life you wish to lead.</p>

<p>Don’t distinguish between work and life. It is one in the same and the sooner you accept that, the sooner you can release all that negativity you feel every time you think about all the work that needs to be done.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m totally against Multi-Level-Marketing(MLM) or any form of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponzi_scheme">Ponzi schemes</a> because it&rsquo;s a questionable business model that does not offer any real values to the society Here&rsquo;s my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/guochen-hou/mlm-thanks-but-no-thanks/460181587333803">reasons</a>.</p>

<p>On top of which, most MLM marketeers are just pure ignorant about the product they are trying to promote. Let&rsquo;s be honest here, they are not really interested in &lsquo;growing&rsquo; you, they are just interested in entry fee you paid up upon joining the organization. More suckers like you joining as their downlinks means more loyalty fees into their pocket.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s more of a joke is that most of these marketeers who approaches you doesn&rsquo;t have the slightest idea about their product or the industry they are in.</p>

<p>Every month or so i&rsquo;ll receive at least 1 of such invites to MLM. AND THEY JUST DONT DIE OFF! So last week i received this message on linkedin:</p>

<p><img src="http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k508/houguochen/ScreenShot2014-02-16at30123pm.png" alt="message1" /></p>

<p>&lsquo;Income diversification&rsquo; is like an instant red flag to me. But being polite, i replied:</p>

<p><img src="http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k508/houguochen/ScreenShot2014-02-16at30929pm.png" alt="message2" /></p>

<p>Soon afterwards it start to sound more fishy in her reply:</p>

<p><img src="http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k508/houguochen/ScreenShot2014-02-16at31133pm.png" alt="message3" /></p>

<p>Ok seriously??? you are running an e-commerce business and your website is only accessible to a selected few??? It&rsquo;s like saying,</p>

<blockquote><p>i&rsquo;m opening a restaurant that only serves my friends and family.</p></blockquote>

<p>Great work so far Amirah. I decided to serve her own medicine back to her.
<img src="http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k508/houguochen/ScreenShot2014-02-16at31714pm.png" alt="message4" /></p>

<p>At this point, the last that she can do to save her sinking ship is to send me some PDFS, DOCS, WEBSITES depicting her business to get me interested. But it seems she doesn&rsquo;t have any to begin with. Alas, this short and apparently-less-friendly message without signoffs came back:
<img src="http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k508/houguochen/ScreenShot2014-02-16at32155pm.png" alt="message5" /></p>

<p>OKAY. BITCHING TIME. My dear Amirah, it seems you don&rsquo;t even understand the difference between &lsquo;a wholesale/retail distribution channel&rsquo; and &lsquo;e-commerce distribution business&rsquo;. A wholesale/retail distribution channel via internet is like <a href="www.ebay.com.sg">eBay</a> or <a href="www.amazon.com">Amazon</a> where you provide a medium for e-commerce business to operate and transact. An e-commerce business is where you USE this medium to perform ecommerce activities. Building an ebay shopfront to sell your products within ebay is totally different from building ebay.com itself. I can&rsquo;t appreciate how you want to hire me to work for you, or as your down-link in your organization, when you can&rsquo;t even figure out this simple difference about the industry you are supposedly to be an expert in. Preaching about a questionable business model is already being frowned upon. The worst you can do is to demonstrate that you know nothing about the industry you are in. Please Amirah, stop this madness.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k508/houguochen/singapore.jpg" alt="singapore" /></p>

<blockquote><p>Great cities attract ambitious people. You can sense it when you walk around one. In a hundred subtle ways, the city sends you a message: you could do more; you should try harder.</p>

<p>The surprising thing is how different these messages can be. New York tells you, above all: you should make more money. There are other messages too, of course. You should be hipper. You should be better looking. But the clearest message is that you should be richer.</p>

<p>What I like about Boston (or rather Cambridge) is that the message there is: you should be smarter. You really should get around to reading all those books you&rsquo;ve been meaning to.</p>

<p>When you ask what message a city sends, you sometimes get surprising answers. As much as they respect brains in Silicon Valley, the message the Valley sends is: you should be more powerful.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not quite the same message New York sends. Power matters in New York too of course, but New York is pretty impressed by a billion dollars even if you merely inherited it. In Silicon Valley no one would care except a few real estate agents. What matters in Silicon Valley is how much effect you have on the world. The reason people there care about Larry and Sergey is not their wealth but the fact that they control Google, which affects practically everyone.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>&mdash; Paul Graham</p></blockquote>

<p>Paul Graham once wrote this article on different messages that a city sends you when you are in it. I like the article alot.
In my words, the message is the city&rsquo;s attitude.</p>

<p>What message does Singapore, the flower city of asia, send?</p>

<p><strong>Follow the rules; Live a secure life.</strong></p>

<p>People living in singapore are good citizens, almost too good for their own good. They follow rules to the letter and abide by government policies rain or shine. Flouting the law is seen as blasphemous and challenging authority in itself almost seemed a criminal activity. You know you are safe as long as you stay within social boundaries.</p>

<p>The city tells you to prepare for the unexpected. What if you lost your job tomorrow? What if you couldn&rsquo;t pay your house mortgages anymore? What if your children couldn&rsquo;t perform academically?</p>

<p>Perhaps it is this constant vibe that the city is giving out, people no longer dare to challenge themselves, the status quo or the rules but default to security. Failure as a result of a challenge is too much to handle, too much of a loss to bear and too shameful to be seen. Oh wait, arn&rsquo;t those the exact sentiments for life&rsquo;s mediocrity?</p>

<p>It is hard to ask a city to change. So we shouldn&rsquo;t stay in a city for too long as we will subconsciously inherit the city&rsquo;s message and live by it as our mantra. Travel around when you are still young. Look at what other cities has to offer. Perhaps that&rsquo;s why people say, <em>Life is a journey</em> and not <em>Life is a place</em>.</p>
