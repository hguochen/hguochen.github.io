    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I will be drawing stacking tables with proper lighting conditions in this lesson. This lesson will gel all of the concepts and laws learnt so far.</p>

<ol>
<li>Begin with a foreshortened square.</li>
<li>Draw two short edges to create the top of the table.</li>
<li>Draw the middle line longer, according to the foreshortened square concept.</li>
<li>Using the lines you have already drawn as areference, draw bottom of the table top in direction of Northeast and Northwest.</li>
<li>Draw middle line longer to create the near edge of the table post.</li>
<li>Draw the sides of the table post. Each side line is drawn halfway from the far edge to the middle line.</li>
<li>Using lines drawn as reference, draw the bottom of the table post in direction NW and NE.</li>
<li>Draw horizon line just above the table. and position light source aboce and to the right. The horizon line tells our eye that the object is below the horizon line, which communicates to our brain that the thickness, shadows, and foreshorteneing are from this perspective.</li>
<li>Place a guide dot directly below the near corner of the table post. If you don&rsquo;t use the guide dot on every stacked table, your drawing may get progressively more skewed and impossibly distorted.</li>
<li>Using lines already drawn as a reference, draw the front edge of the pedestal in directions NW and NE.</li>
<li>Now draw the back edges of the opt of the pedestal, be sure to go behind the corner of the post.</li>
<li>Complete the pedestal, makjing sure to draw the near corner lower. As always, use the lines you have already drawn as reference angles for drawing the bottom lines of the pedestal in directions NW and NE.</li>
<li>Finally, add the cast shadow opposite your positioned light source, shade the table and pedestal and add the dark undershadows of both sides of the post.</li>
</ol>


<p>So here&rsquo;s how my final drawing looks:

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m gona be drawing hollow cubes for this lesson. Drawing lines that <strong>sync</strong> with each other is pretty important when drawing cubes.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Parallel and Perpendicular Lines</strong>
Parallel lines are two lines going in the same direction, spaced equally apart. Perpendicular lines are two lines that intersect at right angles to each other.</p></blockquote>

<ol>
<li>Sketch a foreshortened cube.</li>
<li>Slant back two parallel lines on the top of the cube.</li>
<li>Think of a compass, the 4 most commonly used directions are, <strong>Northwest</strong>, <strong>Northeast</strong>, <strong>Southwest</strong>, and <strong>Southeast</strong>.</li>
<li>Draw the parallel side of the box lid lifting up with two parallel lines.</li>
<li>Use the bottom of the box angles to guide your line directions, complete near the flaps, aligning them up in direction NE and NW. By always referring the lines you have already drawn and by continually checking your angles against the drawing direction reference cube, your drawings will look solid, focused, and 3D.</li>
<li>When casting shadows, we are casting at the SW direction instead of downwards. This will go well with the light source which is in NE direction.</li>
</ol>


<p>Try drawing the cube a few more times to get the directional cues correct. Here&rsquo;s what i&rsquo;ve drawn:

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ok I&rsquo;m moving on to drawing cubes in this lesson. Contrary to my belief, i realized drawing cubes is actually harder than drawing spheres. Let&rsquo;s get started!</p>

<ol>
<li>Starting off, draw two dots across from each other. these 2 dots will determine the diagonal length of the cube.</li>
<li>Place finger between the dots using the opposite hand you are drawing with. Then draw a dot above your finger. These 2 dots should be closer to each other.</li>
<li>Shoot the first line across.</li>
<li>Draw the next line connecting the left dot with the bottom one.</li>
<li>A third line to connect the bottom dot with right dot.</li>
<li>Complete the foreshortened square. Foreshortening means to <strong>distort</strong> an object to create the illusion that part of it is closer to your eye.</li>
<li>Next, draw the sides of the cube with two vertical lines. Use the sides of your sketchbook page as a visual reference to keep your drawings from tilting.</li>
<li>Using the two side lines as reference lines, draw the middle line a bit longer and lower. Using lines you have already drawn to establish angles and positions for your next lines is a crucial technique in creating 3D picture.</li>
<li>Using the top right edge of the top foreshortened square as a reference line. draw the bottom right side of the cube.</li>
<li>Then draw the bottom left side of the cube by referring to the angle of the line above it.</li>
<li>Draw the light source on the top right hand side of the cube and start shading the other sides. Remember nooks and crannies?</li>
</ol>


<p>So here&rsquo;s my result:

<p>Try practicing more with drawing cube like objects. Gift boxes, packages, shoe boxes etc. Once ready, let&rsquo;s go on to <a href="/design/2014/01/20/lesson-5-hollow-cube/">Lesson 5 &ndash; Hollow Cubes</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Feeling comfortable with drawing 3D spheres yet? This lesson we are going to draw a lot more overlapping spheres, to get a feel of how things look like when they are grouped together.</p>

<p><strong>By the way, listening to music while drawing could be a real pleasure :)</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Again, we start with drawing a circle.</li>
<li>Draw another circle behind the first. Push it up a bit ( placement ). Tuck it behind the first ( overlapping ). Draw it a bit smaller ( size ).</li>
<li>Draw the next circle over to the right behind the first one, push it up, tuck it behind and draw it a bit smaller than the first circle.</li>
<li>Onward into the third row of spheres. The row is definitely getting smaller and much higher on the page as you move away from the front sphere. When you draw objects smaller to create the illusion that they are deeper in your picture, you are using the size law. Size is a powerful tool to create depth.</li>
<li>Fill in the far gap with a peeking over-the-top sphere. Remember that small equals deeper.This will create a 3D illusion, even before adding shadows, shading and blendin!</li>
<li>Complete the third row with the end sphere smaller, higher, and behind. Much of 3D is in repition and practice.</li>
<li>Draw the fourth and fifth row of spheres. Pushing each row deeper into your picture with size, placement, and overlapping.</li>
<li>Draw rows six and seven receding into the depths of your sketch page. Size really kicks in on these distant rows.</li>
<li>Finally, we determine the position of our light source. For consistency, we will keep the light positioned in the top right. Go ahead and cast shadows off to the left, on the ground, and opposite your light source position.</li>
<li>Next, draw the horizontal background reference line, the horizon line. The horizon line will help you create the illusion of depth in your drawing.</li>
<li>Still remember Nook and Cranny? Push hard on your pencil and darken the edges and little spots between each ball.</li>
<li>Continue your shading process with a first pass over all the objects, scribbling the shading lightly over all opposite edges away from the light source.</li>
<li>Make some more scribble shading passes. Blend the shading with your finger. Carefully smudge the dark shaded areas up toward the hot spots, lighter and lighter as you go.</li>
</ol>


<p>Looking at your masterpiece already? Here&rsquo;s mine:</p>

<h3>BONUS CHALLENGE</h3>

<p>Take a look at this drawing. The largest sphere is the farthest away. The smallest sphere is the closest. Following the guides above, try to recreate this drawing yourself, and have fun!

    <updated>2014-01-03T00:00:00+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.hguochen.com/design/2014/01/03/lesson-2-overlapping-sphere</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We are going to build on our sphere drawing in lesson 1 by drawing more than 1 spheres. In particular, we are going to overlap them. Still remember the skills to draw a 3D sphere? Let&rsquo;s do this again.</p>

<ol>
<li>Draw a circle.</li>
<li>Draw a second sphere behind the first one. As you draw the second sphere, make it a bit smaller than the first sphere, a bit higher up on the paper, and tucked behind the first sphere. With this, we are using <code>size</code>, <code>placement</code> and <code>overlapping</code> laws. Recap the 9 fundamental laws <a href="/2014/01/02/lesson-1-the-sphere/">here</a>.</li>
<li>Determine where your imaginary light source will be positioned. You will need to do this so you can get a consistent shading in order to appear three-dimensional.</li>
<li>Cast a shadow in the direction opposite the light.</li>
<li>To separate objects in your drawing, draw a dark defining shadow in between the two spheres(called a nook and cranny shadow). This will help identify the two objects. Nook and cranny shadows are always applied under and behind near objects.</li>
<li>Hold your pencil loosely and scribble the first layer of shading on both spheres. Shade the surfaces opposite your light source. Try to make shading lines below all lined up away from the sun.</li>
<li>Make a second darker, more focused shading pass over the spheres. Detail in the very dark edges, and let your scribbles get lighter and lighter as you move slowly toward your established light source. The spot on the sphere adjacent to the light source should be the brightest spot.</li>
<li>Using your finger, carefully blend the shading from dark to light, trying to keep the hit spot crisp white.</li>
</ol>


<h3>BONUS CHALLENGE</h3>

<p>Let&rsquo;s try placing two tennis balls on the table in front of you, overlapping. Make sure to notice the object&rsquo;s placement, shadows, and shading.</p>
