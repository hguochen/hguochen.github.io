    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In 4 day&rsquo;s time, i&rsquo;ll be visiting California-US for the first time in my life. Being <a href="http://hguochen.com">a startup guy</a> myself, this is a big deal for me. I&rsquo;m really excited to see what the biggest startup ecosystem in the world is like. I wanted to make this trip a really memorable one but i didn&rsquo;t have enough contacts there. So i shamelessly cold-emailed some of my favourite tech companies in California asking for an impromptu visit to their offices/campus. Some of these companies accepted my request(thank you so much!). But 1 of which just blew me away. Here&rsquo;s what happened.</p>

<p>I have always been a big fan of <a href="http://evernote.com">Evernote</a>. After several failed attempts to link up with evernote staff through friend introductions, i resorted to cold-emailing its CEO, Phil Libin on linkedin&hellip;</p>

<p><img src="http://i1113.photobucket.com/albums/k508/houguochen/email_phil_libin.jpg" width="500" alt="Email Phil Libin" /></p>

<p>Ok i admit, its kinda cheesy. But hey, i wasn&rsquo;t expecting a reply.</p>

<p>And so i didn&rsquo;t. Then i tried to ping the CEO on twitter, and i got a reply! Well, not Phil Libin himself, but still a reply :)</p>

<p>Things are looking good! So i followed the instructions and the following conversations ensue:</p>

<p>A few days later, this email from Evernote&rsquo;s marketing manager came:</p>

<p>How excited was i to read this? Let&rsquo;s just say that my laptop keyboard now comes coffee-flavoured. Thank you Evernote, you&rsquo;ve just made a fan very very happy :)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be giving a full recount of my visit to Evernote HQ sometime later. In the meantime, please leave in the comments below if you have a request for me on visiting Evernote :)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Had this conversation between some friends the other day and i realised thereâ€™s a few common misconceptions between startups and businesses. Not all businesses can be called startups, while startups most common entity is a business entity.</p>

<p>A start-up, by definition, is a temporary organisation designed to search for a scalable business model. Apart from typical business risks, there are more inherent risks such as finding product-market fit, research deficiencies etc.</p>

<p>A business is a corporate entity that is growth oriented. It has, by default, found its product-market fit and operating on a scalability model.</p>

<p>Starting a company on teleportation or building the next generation flying car is considered a startup. But opening a drink store selling sugared water is not a startup. The baseline being, if you are treading on a previously explored path then your entity is NOT a startup.</p>

<p>On a side note, startups should always move out of its current being as soon as possible. There is no glory in maintaining the buzzword title for x years.</p>
